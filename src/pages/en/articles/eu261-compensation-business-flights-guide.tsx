                  <p className="text-slate-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    No, EU261 compensation amounts are based solely on flight distance, not ticket class or price. A business class passenger receives the same €600 for a delayed transatlantic flight as an economy passenger.

                    What counts as extraordinary circumstances under EU261?

                  <p className="text-slate-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Extraordinary circumstances that exempt airlines from paying compensation include severe weather, political instability, security risks, air traffic control strikes, and medical emergencies. However, technical faults, crew scheduling issues, and airline strikes typically do not qualify.

                    The time limit varies by country, ranging from 2-6 years. UK: 6 years, Germany: 3 years, France: 5 years, Poland: 6 years. Most EU countries allow 2-3 years minimum, so it's worth claiming even for older business trips.

                    Yes, if you (the employee) are the entitled party, you can still claim compensation even if your employer goes bankrupt. The claim is against the airline, not your employer, so company insolvency doesn't affect your rights.
