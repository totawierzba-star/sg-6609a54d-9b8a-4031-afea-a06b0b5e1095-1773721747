              <h2>Why Heathrow Delays Are So Common</h2>
              <p>
                Heathrow operates at <strong>98% capacity</strong> on just two runways, handling over 80 million passengers annually. Unlike Frankfurt (4 runways) or Amsterdam (6 runways), LHR has no buffer for disruptions. A single technical issue, weather event, or ATC restriction creates a domino effect affecting hundreds of flights.
              </p>

                  &quot;Heathrow is always congested, so delays are expected and not compensable.&quot; <strong>FALSE.</strong> Airlines must plan for normal operational challenges. Only unforeseeable, external events (like sudden runway closures or severe weather) are extraordinary. Routine congestion does not exempt them from EU261/UK261.

              <h2>Business Travel Scenarios at Heathrow</h2>
              
              <h3>Scenario 1: Direct Flight Delayed at LHR</h3>
              <p>
                You&apos;re flying London → Frankfurt for a morning meeting. The flight is delayed 4 hours due to &quot;air traffic restrictions at Heathrow.&quot;
              </p>
              <div className="bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 p-4 rounded-lg border border-green-200 dark:border-green-800 my-4">
                <p className="mb-0 text-green-800 dark:text-green-200">
                  <strong>✓ Eligible:</strong> If the restriction was specific to your flight (crew issues, technical problems), you can claim €250. If it was a general ATC slot delay affecting multiple airlines, it&apos;s extraordinary. Airlines must provide evidence.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>Scenario 2: Missed Connection at LHR</h3>
              <p>
                You&apos;re flying New York → London → Munich (both flights on one British Airways booking). The transatlantic leg arrives 90 minutes late, causing you to miss your connection. You arrive in Munich 5 hours late.
              </p>
              <div className="bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 p-4 rounded-lg border border-green-200 dark:border-green-800 my-4">
                <p className="mb-0 text-green-800 dark:text-green-200">
                  <strong>✓ Eligible:</strong> BA is responsible for the entire journey. You&apos;re entitled to €400 (distance: ~900 km from LHR to Munich) because your final arrival was 5 hours late, even though the delay originated on the first leg.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>Scenario 3: Terminal 5 Baggage System Failure</h3>
              <p>
                Your BA flight from Terminal 5 is delayed 4 hours because the automated baggage system failed. British Airways claims this is &quot;outside their control.&quot;
              </p>
              <div className="bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 p-4 rounded-lg border border-green-200 dark:border-green-800 my-4">
                <p className="mb-0 text-green-800 dark:text-green-200">
                  <strong>✓ Eligible:</strong> Terminal 5 is BA&apos;s dedicated hub. They are responsible for operational systems within their terminal. This is NOT an extraordinary circumstance.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2>Post-Brexit: UK261 vs EU261</h2>
              <p>
                Since Brexit, UK flights are covered by <strong>UK261</strong> (a mirror of EU261). The rules are identical, but compensation is paid in GBP instead of EUR:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Flights departing UK:</strong> Always covered by UK261 (any airline)</li>
                <li><strong>Flights arriving in UK from EU:</strong> Only covered if airline is UK/EU-based</li>
                <li><strong>Non-EU airlines:</strong> Not covered for UK arrivals (e.g., Emirates London → Dubai is covered, but Dubai → London is not)</li>
