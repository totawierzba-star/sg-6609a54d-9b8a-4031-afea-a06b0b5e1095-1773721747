                      Under EU261, the passenger (employee) is the legal beneficiary of compensation. However, employment

                      The default legal position is that compensation belongs to the employee, but contractual obligations 
                      can override this.

                      As a freelancer or B2B contractor, you're typically entitled to keep the compensation unless your 
                      contract explicitly states otherwise. B2B contracts have more flexibility than employment contracts, 
                      so review your specific agreement with the client.

                      Is flight delay compensation taxable for employees?

                    <p className="text-slate-700">
                      Tax treatment varies by country. In most EU jurisdictions, compensation received by employees for 
                      personal inconvenience is not taxable. However, if the company receives it as business income, 
                      it becomes part of taxable revenue. Consult a tax advisor for your specific situation.

                    <p className="text-slate-700">
                      If compensation is transferred to the company, it should be recorded as other income or an offset 
                      to travel expenses. If employees keep it, no accounting entry is needed. Companies should have 
                      clear policies documented in travel guidelines and expense reimbursement procedures.

                    <p className="text-slate-700">
                      Best practice is clear communication: document in travel policy whether employees keep compensation 
                      or transfer it to the company. Consider letting employees keep smaller amounts (under €250) and 
                      requiring transfer for larger claims (€400-€600) as a balanced approach that maintains employee 
                      goodwill while recovering significant costs.

                      Yes. ClaimWinger handles both personal and business travel claims. You file as the passenger, and 
                      if your company requires the compensation, you transfer it after receipt. ClaimWinger only charges 
                      a fee if your claim succeeds, making it risk-free to maximize your compensation amount.
