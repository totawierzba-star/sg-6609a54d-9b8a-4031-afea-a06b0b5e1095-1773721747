            <h2>Why Frankfurt Airport Matters for Business Travelers</h2>
            <p>
              Frankfurt Airport (FRA) is a critical hub for European and transatlantic business travel. It's home to Lufthansa, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, and serves as a major Star Alliance connection point. For corporate travelers, Frankfurt delays can have cascading effects on tight schedules.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to FlightStats data (2023-2024), Frankfurt consistently ranks in the <strong>top 20% of European airports for delays</strong>, with peak disruption periods during summer (July-August) and winter storm seasons (December-February).
            </p>

            <h2 id="hub-issues">Common Delay Causes at Frankfurt Hub</h2>
            <p>
              Understanding <em>why</em> delays happen at Frankfurt helps you assess whether your compensation claim is likely to succeed.

            <h3>The "Hub Complexity" Excuse</h3>
            <p>
              Lufthansa and other airlines often cite "operational complexity at Frankfurt hub" as a reason for delays. This is <strong>NOT a valid excuse</strong> under EU261. Airlines are expected to plan for hub congestion and allocate sufficient resources. Only truly extraordinary, unforeseeable events (like sudden ATC strikes or severe weather) exempt them from compensation.
            </p>

            <h2>Compensation Eligibility at Frankfurt</h2>
            <p>
              EU261 applies to all flights <strong>departing from Frankfurt Airport</strong>, regardless of the airline's nationality or your destination. This means:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lufthansa flight Frankfurt → New York (delayed 3+ hours) = eligible</li>
              <li>United flight Frankfurt → Chicago (delayed 3+ hours) = eligible</li>
              <li>Emirates flight Frankfurt → Dubai (delayed 3+ hours) = eligible</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If your flight <strong>arrives at Frankfurt</strong> from outside the EU, compensation only applies if operated by an EU airline (e.g., Lufthansa flight New York → Frankfurt).
            </p>

            <h2>Connecting Flights at Frankfurt: Special Considerations</h2>
            <p>
              Frankfurt is a <strong>primary connection hub</strong>. If you're traveling on business with a connection at FRA (e.g., London → Frankfurt → Singapore), here's what you need to know:
            </p>

            <h3>Single Ticket (One Booking Reference)</h3>
            <p>
              If your entire journey is booked on one ticket (one PNR), the airline is responsible for the full itinerary. If the first flight is delayed and you miss your connection, the airline must rebook you and provide compensation based on your <strong>final destination arrival delay</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> London (LHR) → Frankfurt (FRA) → Singapore (SIN), all on Lufthansa.<br/>
              First flight delayed 2 hours → miss Singapore connection → rebooked on next flight → arrive Singapore 5 hours late.<br/>
              <strong>Compensation:</strong> €600 (distance &gt;3,500 km, delay &gt;4 hours).
            </p>

            <h3>Separate Tickets (Self-Transfer)</h3>
            <p>
              If you booked two separate tickets (e.g., Ryanair London-Frankfurt + Lufthansa Frankfurt-Singapore), the airlines are <strong>not responsible for each other's delays</strong>. You can only claim compensation for the delayed flight itself, not for the missed connection or replacement ticket costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Pro tip for business travelers:</strong> Avoid self-transfers at Frankfurt unless you have 4+ hours buffer time. FRA's minimum connecting time is officially 45-60 minutes, but delays are common.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Claim Compensation for Frankfurt Delays</h2>
            <p>
              The process is the same as for any EU261 claim, but here are Frankfurt-specific tips:
            </p>

            <ol className="space-y-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Document Everything:</strong> Save your boarding passes, booking confirmation, and any delay notifications (SMS, email, airport announcements). Frankfurt's flight information system often displays delay reasons—screenshot them if possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Identify the Airline Responsible:</strong> If it's a codeshare, check your ticket number. If it starts with "LH" (Lufthansa), "LX" (SWISS), or "OS" (Austrian), those airlines are responsible, even if operated by a partner.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Submit Your Claim:</strong> Contact the airline directly or use a claim service like ClaimWinger. Reference EU261 explicitly and provide your Frankfurt departure/arrival details.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Expect Pushback:</strong> Airlines often cite ATC or weather initially. If you believe this is inaccurate (e.g., other flights departed on time), provide evidence (FlightRadar24 screenshots, airport departure boards).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Escalate if Rejected:</strong> If the airline denies your claim unfairly, escalate to your country's National Enforcement Body (NEB) or use the EU's ADR schemes. For Germany-based flights, contact the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA).
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Statistics: Frankfurt Airport Delay Trends (2023-2024)</h2>
            <p>
              Based on aviation industry reports and FlightStats data:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Average delay rate:</strong> 22% of flights delayed &gt;15 minutes (peak summer months).</li>
              <li><strong>Worst months:</strong> July, August (holiday rush), December (winter weather).</li>
              <li><strong>Most affected airlines:</strong> Lufthansa Group (due to hub dominance and crew shortages).</li>
              <li><strong>Common delay durations:</strong> 30-120 minutes (operational), 2+ hours (weather/ATC).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These statistics show that Frankfurt delays are <strong>systemic and predictable</strong>, which strengthens compensation claims. Airlines cannot claim "extraordinary" status for issues they should anticipate.

            <h2>FAQ: Frankfurt Airport Delays & Compensation</h2>
            <Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full not-prose">
              
              <AccordionItem value="item-1">
                <AccordionTrigger>Are Frankfurt Airport operational delays eligible for compensation?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  It depends on the cause. If the delay is due to airline decisions (crew scheduling, maintenance, ground handling by the airline's contractor), it's eligible. If it's due to airport-wide issues (ATC, security strikes, airport authority failures), it's usually considered extraordinary.

              <AccordionItem value="item-2">
                <AccordionTrigger>What if I miss a connecting flight at Frankfurt due to inbound delay?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  If booked on a single ticket (one booking reference), the airline is responsible for the entire journey. Compensation is based on your final destination arrival delay. Minimum connecting time (MCT) at FRA is typically 45-60 minutes.

              </AccordionItem>

              <AccordionItem value="item-3">
                <AccordionTrigger>Does Lufthansa's hub status affect my compensation rights?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  No. Whether Frankfurt is your origin, connection, or destination, EU261 applies equally. Hub congestion or operational complexity does not exempt airlines from compensation obligations.

              <AccordionItem value="item-4">
                <AccordionTrigger>Are weather delays at Frankfurt covered?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Not usually. Severe weather (thunderstorms, heavy fog, snow) is considered extraordinary circumstances. However, if your flight was the only one delayed while others operated normally, the airline must prove the weather specifically affected your flight.

              </AccordionItem>

              <AccordionItem value="item-5">
                <AccordionTrigger>Can I claim if Lufthansa rebooked me through Munich instead?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Yes. If your original Frankfurt connection was delayed/cancelled and you reached your final destination 3+ hours late via the Munich reroute, you're entitled to compensation based on the total delay.
