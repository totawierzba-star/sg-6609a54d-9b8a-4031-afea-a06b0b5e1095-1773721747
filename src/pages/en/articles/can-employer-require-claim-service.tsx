              <h2>Why Companies Want You to Use Their Service</h2>
              <p>
                Many large corporations negotiate volume-based agreements with claim services like AirHelp, Compensair, or regional providers. These agreements typically include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Lower commission rates:</strong> Instead of 25-35% for individual claims, companies may negotiate 15-20% when processing dozens or hundreds of claims per year.</li>
                <li><strong>Centralized tracking:</strong> HR or travel managers can see all active claims in one dashboard.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct payment to company:</strong> If the company claims the compensation (rare), the service pays the company directly, simplifying accounting.</li>
                <li><strong>Kickbacks or rebates:</strong> Some agreements include annual rebates based on total claim volume.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                From a corporate perspective, this makes sense. But does it override your legal rights as a passenger?
              </p>

              <h2 id="legal-analysis">Legal Analysis: Employment Contract vs. EU261</h2>
              
              <div className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 my-6">
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-300 mt-0 mb-2">
                  The Core Principle
                </h3>
                <p className="mb-0 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">
                  <strong>EU Regulation 261/2004</strong> grants compensation rights to the <strong>passenger</strong> who experienced the inconvenience. The regulation does not distinguish between private and business travel. The compensation is a <strong>personal entitlement</strong>, similar to a consumer protection right.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>Scenario 1: No Contract Clause (Most Common)</h3>
              <p>
                If your employment contract does <strong>not</strong> mention flight compensation, then:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>You are the legal beneficiary of EU261 compensation.</li>
                <li>You can choose any claim service you want (ClaimWinger, AirHelp, or claim directly).</li>
                <li>Your employer <strong>cannot</strong> force you to use their preferred service through a policy document, handbook, or verbal instruction.</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 p-4 rounded-lg border border-green-200 dark:border-green-800 my-4">
                <p className="mb-0 text-green-800 dark:text-green-200">
                  <strong>✓ Your Right:</strong> Use any service or claim directly from the airline. The employer has no legal basis to object.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>Scenario 2: Contract Clause Assigning Compensation to Employer</h3>
              <p>
                Some contracts (especially in consulting or finance) include clauses like:
              </p>
              <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-slate-300 pl-4 italic text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
                &quot;Any compensation, refunds, or reimbursements arising from business travel shall be property of the company.&quot;
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                If such a clause exists and is <strong>legally valid</strong> in your jurisdiction (check with a local employment lawyer), then:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The employer can claim the compensation.</li>
                <li>The employer can choose the claim service.</li>
                <li>You have no say in the process.</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 p-4 rounded-lg border border-red-200 dark:border-red-800 my-4">
                <p className="mb-0 text-red-800 dark:text-red-200">
                  <strong>⚠ Important:</strong> Such clauses are <strong>rare</strong> and may be unenforceable in some EU countries (e.g., Germany, France) where consumer protection laws are very strong. Always verify with a lawyer.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>Scenario 3: Contract Requires Using Specific Service</h3>
              <p>
                A middle-ground scenario: Your contract states that <strong>if</strong> you claim compensation, you must use the company&apos;s designated service. This is more common in large corporations with centralized travel management.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Legally valid?</strong> Possibly, if the clause is clearly written and you signed the contract knowingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Enforceable?</strong> Depends on your country&apos;s employment law. In some jurisdictions, such clauses may be considered an unfair restriction on your personal rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Practical impact:</strong> The company may argue you breached your contract if you use another service, but they likely cannot reclaim the compensation from you personally.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>What About Policy Documents or Travel Handbooks?</h2>
              <p>
                Many companies issue internal policies like:
              </p>
              <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-slate-300 pl-4 italic text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
                &quot;Employees must use [Company X] for all flight delay claims.&quot;
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                <strong>Legal weight:</strong> In most EU countries, policy documents are <strong>not legally binding</strong> unless they are incorporated into your employment contract by reference. A standalone handbook or email policy cannot override your EU261 passenger rights.
              </p>

              <div className="bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-900/20 p-4 rounded-lg border border-amber-200 dark:border-amber-800 my-4">
                <p className="mb-0 text-amber-800 dark:text-amber-200">
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to use a different service, check your <strong>employment contract</strong>, not just the travel policy. If the contract is silent, you have the right to choose.
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                If your company has a corporate agreement with another service but your contract doesn&apos;t require it, you can:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Check your employment contract</strong> for any clauses about compensation.</li>
                <li><strong>Politely inform HR/Travel Manager</strong> that you prefer to use ClaimWinger because [reason: better service, faster payout, personal preference].</li>
                <li><strong>Submit your claim via ClaimWinger.</strong> The airline doesn&apos;t care which service you use—they only see the passenger&apos;s name.</li>
                <li><strong>If the company objects</strong>, ask them to cite the specific contract clause that requires their service. If they can&apos;t, they have no legal basis to stop you.</li>

              <Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full not-prose">
                
                <AccordionItem value="item-1">
                  <AccordionTrigger>Can my employer force me to use a specific claim service?</AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    Generally, no. EU261 compensation belongs to the passenger, not the employer. Unless your employment contract explicitly states that compensation must be transferred to the company OR processed through their designated service, you are free to choose how to claim your compensation.

                <AccordionItem value="item-2">
                  <AccordionTrigger>What if my company has a corporate account with a claim service?</AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    Having a corporate account doesn&apos;t automatically give the employer rights to your compensation. However, many companies negotiate better commission rates (e.g., 15% instead of 25%) through volume agreements. This can actually benefit you if the employer keeps the standard rate and you get more money.

                <AccordionItem value="item-3">
                  <AccordionTrigger>Can I use ClaimWinger if my company prefers another service?</AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    Yes. As long as your employment contract doesn&apos;t require a specific service, you have the legal right to choose ClaimWinger or any other service you trust. The compensation is your personal entitlement under EU261.

                </AccordionItem>

                <AccordionItem value="item-4">
                  <AccordionTrigger>What happens if I signed a policy document agreeing to use the company service?</AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    Policy documents are not legally binding in most EU countries unless they are part of your employment contract. A standalone travel policy or handbook section typically cannot override your EU261 passenger rights. However, consult a local employment lawyer if you&apos;re uncertain.

                <AccordionItem value="item-5">
                  <AccordionTrigger>Can my employer deduct claim service fees from my salary?</AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    No. If the compensation belongs to you (which is the default under EU261), the employer cannot deduct fees for processing your personal claim. If they paid for the ticket and are claiming the compensation themselves, they bear the service costs.
                  </AccordionContent>
                </AccordionItem>

                <AccordionItem value="item-6">
                  <AccordionTrigger>What if my contract says compensation belongs to the employer?</AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    Then the employer can choose the claim service and process the claim themselves. However, such clauses are uncommon and may be challenged in some jurisdictions. Always check your local employment law.
